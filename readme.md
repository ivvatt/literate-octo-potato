Hello world! This is GIT repository.
Any changes you make are sotred into your computer, but to commit them to the repository (actually change the file you're working on), you need to stage them.
Push a repository - move it from one system (my computer) to another (the GIT website) => automatically save changes to this repository (the computer knows that this is the repository you want to push to); have a remote repository to be communicating with
==> push/pull changes to and from the remote server
